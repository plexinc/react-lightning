# How focus works

All focusable elements are added to a tree, based on their position in the
render tree. Navigation between elements is calculated based on direction of
navigation and proximity to the next element.

The `FocusGroup` component is used to manage focus for a group of elements. It
ensures that only one element in the group can have focus at a time. It is also
used for calculating the next and previous focusable elements, based on the
direction you press when navigating.

FocusGroups can be nested. If a focusable element is not found within a
FocusGroup, the parent FocusGroup will attempt to find the next or previous
element to focus.

### Example

<Canvas
  of={SimpleFocusTree}
  layout="centered"
  withToolbar
/>
