# Lightning Components

Components in react-lightning are written differently from the ways they're done
in [Blits](https://lightningjs.io/v3-docs/blits/essentials/components.html). As
you may suspect, react-lightning components are written in React.

## Primitives

Similar to React, components in react-lightning are built using primitives.
There are three primitive components in react-lightning, all prefixed with
`lng-`. React primitives like `div`, `span`, and `img` are not used in react-lightning.

- *lng-view*
  - `lng-view` is a container component that can hold other components, similar to
    a `div` element in HTML.
- lng-text
  - `lng-text` is a text component for rendering text content.
- lng-image
  - `lng-image` is an image component that will render an image.

## Styling

Styling in react-lightning is done using the `style` prop. The `style` prop is
almost a 1:1 mapping of the props you would set on a Lightning component. You
can see a full list of the supported props from the [Lightning.js
source](https://github.com/lightning-js/renderer/blob/6f8e057b4928d40b7433382267b3133ebdcbb8a0/src/core/CoreNode.ts#L214),
with a few exceptions.
